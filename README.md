# GT-Shop - JavaScript Implementation
This is the frontend part of GT Shop, a rewards store I built for GeneraÈ›ia Tech's Spring 2025 microproject. Users can browse products, add stuff to their cart and "buy" rewards using Activity Points they earn from courses/exercises.

[Live Demo](https://roxanad01.github.io/GT-Shop)  

## What I Built
The whole JavaScript side of the shop. Basically, everything you see and interact with in the browser, from clicking on products to checking out your cart.

## Main Features
### Rewards

- Products organised in collapsible categories (Vouchere, Abonamente, GenTech stuff, etc.)
- Click on any product to see full details in a modal

### Cart

- Add/remove products
- Change quantities with +/- buttons
- Shows total points needed
- Validates if you have enough AP before checkout
- Automatically opens address form for physical products

### Filtering & Sorting

- Search by product name
- Filter by multiple categories at once
- Sort by price, alphabetically or by category

### User Profile

- Shows user's name, avatar, and current AP balance
- Send AP to other users (type their email/Discord)
- Points update automatically after purchases

### Purchase History

- See all the past orders grouped by transaction
- Shows AWB tracking numbers for physical items
- Distinguishes between digital and physical products

This microproject includes a multidisciplinary team with one person from each field: 
Project Manager, Java Developer, JavaScript Developer, Web Design (Figma), WordPress Developer and Digital Marketing
